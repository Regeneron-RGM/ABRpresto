example_data	
*During the recording, stimuli were presented in interleaved order such that a train of tone-pips containing a single presentation of each level and frequency was repeated in an interleaved ramp paradigm (as described in Buran et al. 2020)
*Each csv file contains single trial waveforms for one frequency and all levels tested
*Example 1: 8 kHz
*Example 2: 32 kHz
*Example 3: 4 kHz
*Example 4: 22.6 kHz
*Example 5: 16 kHz"
